The project revolves around the practical application of linear regression techniques, encompassing both simple and multiple regression, to real-world datasets. The project encompasses various technical aspects, including:
•	Modeling: Building and fitting linear regression models to explore and quantify relationships between dependent and independent variables.
•	Statistical Analysis: Conducting rigorous statistical analyses, involving hypothesis testing, significance testing, and precise estimation of model parameters.
•	Feature Selection: Employing advanced feature selection methods to identify relevant independent variables, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.
•	Multicollinearity Handling: Addressing multicollinearity challenges through techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), ensuring robust and stable model results.
•	Data Transformation: Implementing data transformations, when necessary, to meet model assumptions and improve predictive accuracy.
•	Interpretation: Skillfully interpreting regression coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and model significance to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
